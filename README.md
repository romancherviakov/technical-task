# Amadeus It Group PHP Developer Technical Task

## Overview

Hello %username%. Here would be your start point in big amadeus company. This task is like a game and I hope it would
be interesting. In any case, imagine a zoo. It contains animals. Animals like birds, fish, etc. These animals have 
their abilities, for instance, birds can fly, fish can swim, monkeys can walk. Every animal has to eat, that's why 
every animal has such ability. There are several issues and we hope you'd solve them for us.
